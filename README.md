# Mini Feature Phone (C Project)

This project simulates a basic feature phone experience using the C programming language. It aims to consolidate several everyday tools into a single, easy-to-use interface, reducing the need for multiple devices. All code is contained within a single file: `mini_feature_phone.c`.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to provide a single application encompassing several commonly used functionalities. Instead of relying on separate devices for calculations, timekeeping, scheduling, and contact management, this project combines these features into one. Inspired by classic Nokia feature phones, this application provides a convenient and accessible solution for daily tasks.

## Features

This "Mini Feature Phone" includes the following features:

*   **Calendar:** Displays a calendar for a specified year.
*   **Calculator:** Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Stopwatch:** Allows users to time events.
*   **Phone Book:** Manages contacts, enabling users to:
    *   Add new contacts.
    *   Search for existing contacts.
    *   Delete contacts.
    *   View all saved contacts.
*   **Game:** Provides a simple entertainment option with general knowledge-based questions.
